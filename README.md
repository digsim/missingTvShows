# Usage

Simply launch [missingTvShows]{.title-ref} to get help and instructions
on how to use the tool

```bash
‚îî‚îÄ\>Ôêò master üïô 12:29:38 ‚ùØ missingTvShows -h usage: missingtvshows
\[-h\] \[-v\] {sync} \...

Checks missing TV Show Episodes based on the list of available
Episodes on thetvdb.com

positional arguments: {sync} commands sync sync Kodi and TVDB

options: -h, \--help show this help message and exit -v, \--version
show program\'s version number and exit

missingtvshows {command} -h for help on individual commands
```

The `missingTvShows` relies on two config files sitting in
`~/.MissingTVShows`:

-   `tvshows.conf` : main configuration file of missingTvShows.
-   `logging.conf`: logging configuration

These two files are created on the first run and at least the
`tvshows.conf` need to be adapted accordingly:


```
[Config]
api_key: <thetvdb_api_key>
tvdbdb:  ./tvdbdb.db # location of the sqlite3 cache of tvdb information relative to this file
[Database] # coordinates of the Kodi DB, supports mysql and sqlite3
#dialect: sqlite
#db: /Volumes/Data/ruppena/Documents/Programming/Python/missing_tv_shows_for_xbmc/test.db
dialect: mysql # one of mysql, sqlite
db: MyVideos121 # in case of mysql the name of the DB in case of sqlite3 the full filepath
user: <mysql_user>
passwd: <mysql_passwor>
hostname: <mysql_host>
port:<mysql_port>
```

and it produces the following two files (also in `~/.MissingTVShows`):

* `tvdbdb.db` : cached thetvdb information
* `tvshows.log` : log of the last run
